# Hacked FastTree

## How it works

This is a slightly hacked version of FastTree. The script executes the exact same algorithm. Additionally, it prints an output file containing the list of intermediate trees that FastTree visited throughout the tree search. More specifically, when FastTree conducts a topological move (because the algorithm has evaluated the new topology with higher log-likelihood score), the new topology is appended to the output file named `{prefix}.chkpTrees`, where `{prefix}` is the common prefix of all output files.

## Example

To complie the hacked version:

```
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

To run a single tree search on the example dataset (`15758_1`), using a random starting tree generated by RAxML-NG:

```
./FastTree -gamma -gtr -nt -cat 4 -log myrun.log -intree1 15758_1/random_starting.Tree < 15758_1/15758_1.phy > tree_file 
```

The output file named `myrun.chkpTrees` contains the checkpoint trees
