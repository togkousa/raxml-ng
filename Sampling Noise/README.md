# Sampling Noise

This folder documents two additional stopping criteria based on Sampling Noise (SN). These methods were initially included in the first version of the manuscript available on [biorxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.602058). However, the SN-based methods performed poorly compared to the KH-based approaches, which led us to exclude them from the main manuscript.

Despite their suboptimal performance, we believe that negative results should be documented. These methods may still inspire readers interested in developing new techniques to accelerate maximum-likelihood (ML) tree inference.

The file `Supplement_old.pdf` is an earlier, unpublished version of the Supplementary Material for our stopping criteria manuscript. While some content overlaps with the current Supplement, this document provides a detailed theoretical background for the SN-based methods, along with a comprehensive evaluation against RAxML-NG v1.2, sRAxML-NG, and KH-based methods.
